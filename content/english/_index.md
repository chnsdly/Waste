    designation: "Operations Manager, Municipal Sanitation Contractor (Vietnam)"
    content: "During rainy season and on hot pavements, old bins took in water and lids warped. After switching to Baoheng 240L, lid sealing improved and there’s almost no water accumulation after heavy rain. Engagement with lifter trucks is smooth, making early-morning collection steadier and quieter. Breakage has dropped significantly over two seasons, and spare parts supply keeps up."

    image: "images/clients/avater-2.jpg"
    designation: "Facilities Manager, Shopping Center (Denmark)"
    content: "Peak traffic in the food court means frequent pedal use. The 30/45/60L pedal bins press smoothly and return cleanly; the soft-close variant is quieter for night cleaning. Smooth inner walls resist buildup, and daily alkaline washing is fine. After months, hinges remain tight, and replacement frequency is clearly lower than our previous brand."

    designation: "Campus Logistics, University (Saudi Arabia)"
    content: "With summer near 45°C and strong UV, ordinary bins fade and deform. Baoheng 120/240L outdoor bins retained color and stiffness over a semester; casters still roll well on hot ground. Sorting stickers and custom logos adhere firmly for inspections and asset control, and batch replenishments arrived on schedule."
